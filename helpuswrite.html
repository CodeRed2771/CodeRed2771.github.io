<h1>Help Us Write</h1>
<h2>We can't do this on our own!</h2>
<p>Making a complete guide to the FRC controls system is a lot of work,
  so we are asking the visitors to our site to assist us in adding content.
  Any time you can spare to this project would be helpful, even if you only
  submit half of a page.  All you need to do to submit a page is shoot an email
  to <a href="mailto:coderedcontrols@gmail.com">coderedcontrols@gmail.com</a>
  with the page title and content.  <b>It does not need to be HTML formatted.</b>  We can do that.
  The hard part is actually writing all of the pages.  If you include an author
  name (nicknames encouraged!), we will happily give you credit.<br><br>If you
  have any other questions or feedback for us, we want to hear it!  Similarly,
  send them to our email address, it is the best way to contact us.<br><br>Thank
  you for your support of our project.
