<p>In order to make our robot move, we are going to need to be able to control
the motors.  We do this with a piece of hardware called a motor controller. Each
motor needs its own motor controller.  Motor controllers can operate with one of
two protocols, but we are going to focus on only one in this tutorial: PWM. PWM
is a way for us to tell the motor controllers what we want them to do.</p>

<p>The list of permitted motor controllers for the 2016 season is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jaguar Motor Controller</li>
  <li>Talon Motor Controller</li>
  <li>Talon SRX Motor Controller</li>
  <li>Victor 884 Motor Controller</li>
  <li>Victor 888 Motor Controller</li>
  <li>Victor SP Motor Controller</li>
  <li>SD540 Motor Controller</li>
  <li>Spark Motor Controller</li>
</ul>
<p class="tip">
  <b>Why use <code>Victor</code> when uncertain?</b>
PWM works the same for all the controllers, so it doesn't matter what object
is used unless you are using additional features of the motor controller. </p>

<p>Each type of motor controller comes with their own class in the WPI Java
library. (The Jaguar uses the <code>Jaguar</code> object, the Talon SRX uses the
<code>TalonSRX</code> object, and so on.)  If you are uncertain on which class
to use, the safest bet would be to use the <code>Victor</code> object.</p>

<p>Enough talk, let's write some code.  I am going to be using a
<code>Talon</code>, but you don't have to.  Simply replace all my
<code>Talon</code> objects with the class of your choice.  Let's make a robot
with two motor controllers: left and right. At the top of your main robot class,
declare your motor controllers:</p>

{% highlight java %}
Talon left;
Talon right;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now we need to instantiate them.  Do this in your <code>robotInit()</code>
method. The constructor of a motor controller object takes one integer: the port
on the roboRIO that the motor controller is plugged into.  I am going to plug
the left motor controller into port 0, and the right into port 1.</p>

{% highlight java %}
public void robotInit() {
    left = new Talon(0);
    right = new Talon(1);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let's make them move!  You only need to know one method: the
<code>set()</code> method.  It takes one double as a parameter: the speed that
the motor should go. The speed can be anywhere from -1 to 1, where -1 is full
speed backwards, 1 is full speed forwards, and 0 is stop.  To make both left and
right motors move forward at 20% speed, we can add this code to our
<code>teleopPeriodc()</code> method:</p>

{% highlight java %}
public void teleopPeriodic() {
    left.set(0.2);
    right.set(0.2);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="important">It is important to note that the motor will continue to run
at that speed until <code>set()</code> is called again with a different value.</p>

<p>Now when we enable the robot, we will see the left and right motors move
forward at 20% speed.  If you have deployed this code to your robot, one of the
motors may have gone backwards.  This is due to motors being mounted in the
opposite orientation, and thus forward in code becomes backwards on the physical
motor. To fix this issue, simply add a negative sign where it is needed.  (For
example, let's say your left motor is moving backwards):</p>

{% highlight java %}
left.set(-0.2);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>should fix it up.

<h2>Using Code Red's Robot Library</h2>

<p>An alternative way to control motors is using Code Red's Robot Library.  Make
sure that you have the library setup in your environment before continuing. When
using the Robot Library, all motor controllers use the
<code>PWMController</code> object.  This object does much more than simply set
motor speeds, but that is beyond the scope of this lesson and will be covered
later.   Here is the same code we just wrote, but using the
<code>PWMController</code> object:</p>

{% highlight java %}
PWMController left;
PWMController right;

public void robotInit() {
    left = new PWMController(0, true);
    right = new PWMController(1, false);
}

public void teleopPeriodic() {
    left.set(0.2);
    right.set(0.2);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Notice that the constructor for the <code>PWMController</code> object takes
an additional boolean.  The boolean indicates whether the motor is mounted on
the robot backwards or not.  If it is mounted backwards, simply pass
<code>true</code> into the constructor of the motor controller, and you will not
need to worry about using any negatives later on in your code. </p>

<p>That's it for this lesson!  In the next lesson we are going to learn about
getting joystick input.</p>
