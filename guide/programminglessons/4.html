<p>Making a motor spin is great, but we need to be able to link the
speed of the motor with a joystick on a controller.  For this, we can use the
<code>Joystick</code> class.</p>

<p>First, let's declare our Joystick:</p>

{% highlight java %}
Joystick j;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>and instantiate it in the <code>robotInit()</code> method:</p>

{% highlight java %}
j = new Joystick(0);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code>Joystick</code> constructor takes one parameter: the port the
gamepad is mapped to in the Driver Station software.  Normally we start counting
at 0, so I have assigned my gamepad to port 0.</p>

<p>Getting the actual input from the joystick can be a little tricky.  This is
due to the <code>Joystick</code> class not giving human names to all of the
axes and buttons.  Each axis and button on the controller has a special ID. Here
are two tables of all the IDs for a Logitech F310 Gamepad, which is the most
widely used controller:</p>

<table style="float: left">
  <tr>
    <th>Axis</th>
    <th>ID</th>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Left Stick X</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Left Stick Y</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Right Stick X</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Right Stick Y</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>Left Trigger</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Right Trigger</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table style="display: inline-block;margin-left: 50px;">
  <tr>
    <th>Button</th>
    <th>ID</th>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Button A</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Button B</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Button X</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Button Y</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Left Bumper</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Right Bumper</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Back</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Start</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Left Stick</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Right Stick</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>Whew!  You may have noticed that the D-pad is missing.  We will get to that
later.  Lets put these IDs into practice.  Check out the following code:</p>

{% highlight java %}
boolean isPressed = j.getRawButton(1);
double axisValue = j.getRawAxis(1);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>See if you can figure out what is happening here.  The value of
<code>isPressed</code> will be <code>true</code> if the A button is pressed,
and <code>false</code> if it is not pressed.  The value of
<code>axisValue</code> depends on where the Y axis on the left stick is being
pushed.  Axis values run from -1 to 1, just like motor controllers do.  When the
Axis is in the center, <code>getRawAxis()</code> will return 0.  This way, we can
feed joystick input directly into the <code>set()</code> method of a motor
controller.  Let's revisit the motor controller code we made in the last
lesson:</p>

{% highlight java %}
public class MyRobot extends IterativeRobot {

    Talon left;
    Talon right;

    public void robotInit() {
        left = new Talon(0);
        right = new Talon(1);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        left.set(0.2);
        right.set(0.2);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="important">Without looking at the next code block, see if you can
update this code to use the left and right sticks to control the motors.  This
is called tank drive.</p>

<p>So, remember how I said you can feed joystick input directly into a motor
controller?  Here is what it would look like to control the left motor with the
Y axis on the left stick:</p>

{% highlight java %}
left.set(j.getRawAxis(1));
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Can you complete the tank drive code now?  Here is my completed tank drive code:</p>

{% highlight java %}
public class MyRobot extends IterativeRobot {

    Talon left;
    Talon right;
    Joystick j;

    public void robotInit() {
        left = new Talon(0);
        right = new Talon(1);
        j = new Joystick(0);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        left.set(j.getRawAxis(1));
        right.set(j.getRawAxis(5));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="important">Remember: you may need to add negatives for motors that are
mounted backwards.</p>

<p>I said I would save the D-pad for later... well it's later.  The WPI Java
Library considers the D-pad to be a "POV."  The Logitech F310 only has one POV,
so the ID of the D-pad is 0.  If we had a controller with more POVs, their IDs
would be 1, then 2, and so on.  In order to get input from the D-pad, we use the
<code>getPOV()</code> method.</p>

{% highlight java %}
int dpadDirection = j.getPOV(0);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>What?  How do I use that?  Well, <code>getPOV()</code> returns the angle of the
POV in degrees, or -1 if the POV is not pressed.  This can be challenging if we
are trying to use the D-pad as a simple button.  We can interpret this angle to
see what button on the D-pad is pressed.  Here are some examples:</p>

{% highlight java %}
int direction = j.getPOV(0);

if (direction == 0) { // DPAD UP button is pressed
  // do something
} else if (direction == 180) { // DPAD DOWN button is pressed
  // do something else
}

// You can interpret the D-pad as an axis as well:
double dpadYAxisValue = Math.cos(Math.toRadians(direction));
double dpadXAxisValue = Math.sin(Math.toRadians(direction));

someMotorController.set(dpadYAxisValue);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>0Â° is located at the top of the D-pad, and the angles rotate clockwise like
this:</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When the A button is pressed, spin a motor.  Stop the motor when the
    button is released.</li>
  <li>Create a tank drive.  Then, add a gearing system: when the A button is
    pressed, the motors should only be able to run at 50% capacity.  When the A
    button is released, the motors should run at 100% capacity.  To make this
    exercise more challenging, add more gears.  <i>Hint: multiply the
    speed</i></p></li>
</ul>

<p>You may be thinking to yourself: this <code>Joystick</code> class is dumb!
How am I going to remember all of those IDs?  And why does the D-pad have to be
so weird? Well, I think the exact same thing.  That's why I recommend using Code
Red's Robot Library.  If you are using the Robot Library, go ahead and read the
next section.  Otherwise, go on to the next lesson.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Using Code Red's Robot Library</h2>

<p>Our Robot Library has a <i>very</i> expansive package for getting gamepad
input.  We are not going to worry about the finer details of this package in
this lesson, but I do want to cover the basics as using our library is arguably
easier than using the <code>Joystick</code> class.</p>

<p>Our library has a <code>HID</code> class which manages all the controller
input. Here is how you can create a <code>HID</code> object.</p>

{% highlight java %}
HID gamepad1 = new HID(0);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Just as in the <code>Joystick</code> class, the constructor takes an integer
representing the port that the gamepad is mapped to in the Driver Station
software.</p>

<p>In order to hide the arbitrary numbers of the <code>Joystick</code> class, we
made several classes that assign human names to these numbers. We have classes
for a few different kinds of controllers, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Logitech F310</li>
  <li>Logitech Rumblepad 2</li>
  <li>Saitech Joystick</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is how you use the <code>LogitechF310</code> class to get axis/button
input:</p>

{% highlight java %}
HID gamepad1 = new HID(0);

boolean isPressed = gamepad1.button(LogitechF310.A);
double axisValue = gamepad1.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In the last code snippet, <code>isPressed</code> is <code>true</code> if the
A button is pressed and <code>false</code> if it is not pressed.  Also,
<code>axisValue</code> depends on where the Y axis on the left stick is
currently at.  This also works for the D-pad:</p>

{% highlight java %}
boolean left = gamepad1.button(LogitechF310.DPAD_LEFT);
boolean right = gamepad1.button(LogitechF310.DPAD_RIGHT);
boolean up = gamepad1.button(LogitechF310.DPAD_UP);
boolean down = gamepad1.button(LogitechF310.DPAD_DOWN);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You should know what that does.  For your reference, here is a list of all
the button/axis names in our library:</p>

<p><b>Axes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>STICK_LEFT_X</li>
  <li>STICK_LEFT_Y</li>
  <li>TRIGGER_LEFT_AXIS</li>
  <li>TRIGGER_RIGHT_AXIS</li>
  <li>STICK_RIGHT_X</li>
  <li>STICK_RIGHT_Y</li>
  <li>DPAD_X</li>
  <li>DPAD_Y</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Buttons:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>A</li>
  <li>B</li>
  <li>X</li>
  <li>Y</li>
  <li>BUMPER_LEFT</li>
  <li>BUMPER_RIGHT</li>
  <li>BACK</li>
  <li>START</li>
  <li>STICK_LEFT</li>
  <li>STICK_RIGHT</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, that is enough for now.  As I have already mentioned, this is not a
comprehensive list of features of our <code>HID</code> class, and we will cover
this more later.</p>
