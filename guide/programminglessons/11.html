<p>Mecanum drive allows movement in any direction.  Thus, it is useful for games
where maneuverability is required.  Mecanum does eliminate basically all pushing
ability, so don't expect to win in a pushing match with another robot.</p>

<p>Do how do we program mecanum?  There are different ways to do it.  You may
find a different way that works just as well as the method I am going to teach
you.  Before we  start writing any code, lets do a little bit of preplanning.
First, what joysticks will we need to use?  Since mecanum moves in all
directions, I recommend having one whole stick (both x and y) controlling the
direction of the robot, and another axis controlling rotation.  This is a total
of three axes: x, y, and rot.  But what math do we need to do to calculate what
wheels should spin and when?  The y-axis is the easiest.  When you push it to 1,
all the wheels should spin forward, when you push it to -1, they should all
spin back.  Lets create some variables for each wheel and store this value.
I will be using the HID object from the Code Red Library to get joystick input
in this lesson.</p>

{% highlight java %}
double leftF, leftB, rightF, rightB; // front & back, left & right

leftF = gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);
rightF = gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);
leftB = gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);
rightB = gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you test this code, you can see that pushing the left stick forward will
make the robot move forward, and pushing it backward will make the robot move
backward. Don't forget that you may need to add negatives, as we have learned
before, to account for certain motors being mounted in the reverse orientation.
(If you are using <code>PWMController</code> then just set backwards to
<code>true</code> in the constructor.)</p>

<p>OK, let's do side-to-side movement.  In order to move sideways, the wheels
need to spin against each other.  See the diagram below to see what way the
wheels need to spin for each direction.  We can simply add values from the
x-axis on the gamepad to the variables we already have.  This can result in a
motor speed greater than 1, but we will account for that later.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/programminglessons/mecanum_diagram.png"/>

<p>We can use negatives to make the wheels spin against each other.  Here is the
code you should add to do side-to-side movement:</p>

{% highlight java %}
leftF += gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X);
rightF += -gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X);
leftB += -gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X);
rightB += gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Again, you may need to add/remove negatives.  Let's talk about rotation.  When the robot
is rotating to the right, the right wheels move backwards and the left move forward.
We can add this code to account for that:</p>

{% highlight java %}
leftF += gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X);
rightF += -gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X);
leftB += gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X);
rightB += -gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I mentioned this earlier, but hopefully you have been paying attention enough
to realize: "This shouldn't work, some of the values could be more than 1".
You're right.  There is a way to make it work though.  We find the maximum value
out of these four numbers, and if it is bigger than 1, divide each value by that max.
This will scale each motor output down to an appropriate value.</p>

{% highlight java %}
double max = Math.max(Math.max(Math.abs(leftF), Math.abs(rightF)), Math.max(Math.abs(leftB), Math.abs(rightB)));

if (max > 1) {
    leftF = leftF / max;
    rightF = rightF / max;
    leftB = leftB / max;
    rightB = rightB / max;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>All that is left to do is to give these values to the motors:</p>

{% highlight java %}
motorFL.set(leftF);
motorFR.set(rightF);
motorBL.set(leftB);
motorBR.set(rightB);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I really hope you understand why this works... but you probably don't. It's
difficult to explain, but let me try summing it up.  You have three inputs.
Each of these inputs acts on each of the four wheels. You add up the total of
all the inputs for each wheel.  There is a high chance that these totals are
going to be more than 1, so we scale all the values down to numbers that are
appropriate for the motor controllers.  The negatives that I have in my code are
there because side-to-side movement and rotation require some wheels to spin
different directions to get the desired motion.</p>

<p>Here is the completed code:</p>

{% highlight java %}

double leftF, leftB, rightF, rightB; // front & back, left & right

leftF = gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);
rightF = gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);
leftB = gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);
rightB = gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y);

leftF += gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X);
rightF += -gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X);
leftB += -gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X);
rightB += gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X);

leftF += gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X);
rightF += -gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X);
leftB += gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X);
rightB += -gamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X);


double max = Math.max(Math.max(Math.abs(leftF), Math.abs(rightF)), Math.max(Math.abs(leftB), Math.abs(rightB)));

if (max > 1) {
    leftF = leftF / max;
    rightF = rightF / max;
    leftB = leftB / max;
    rightB = rightB / max;
}

motorFL.set(leftF);
motorFR.set(rightF);
motorBL.set(leftB);
motorBR.set(rightB);
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Using Code Red's library</h2>
<p>Fortunately it's easy to implement a mecanum drive using the Code Red Robot
Library. It's important to understand why the library works, however.  Do not
simply skip over the above section and only learn this way.  The Robot Library
allows you to not reinvent the wheel.  Since you know how to write mecanum drive
now, you could do it for 10 different robots and it would be the exact same for
each one.  That's why we added it into the library.</p>

<p>There is a class called <code>Drive</code> in the library. The goal of the
drive object is to control the entire drive train. The library has two different
types of drive trains, each with their own class that extend the base
<code>Drive</code> class.  These two drive trains are tank and mecanum.  Let's
implement mecanum.  Lets also use some PWMControllers for our motors, and let's
say that the left two motors are mounted on to the robot upside-down. Here is
the entire main robot class required to get the robot moving with mecanum
drive:</p>

{% highlight java %}
public class Robot extends IterativeRobot {

    PWMController leftF, leftB, rightF, rightB;
    HID driveGamepad;
    Drive drive;

    public void robotInit() {
        driveGamepad = new HID(0);
        leftF = new PWMController(Wiring.FRONT_LEFT_MOTOR, true); // this motor is mounted in reverse
        leftB = new PWMController(Wiring.REAR_LEFT_MOTOR, true); // so is this one
        rightF = new PWMController(Wiring.FRONT_RIGHT_MOTOR, false);
        rightB = new PWMController(Wiring.REAR_RIGHT_MOTOR, false);

        drive = new MecanumDrive(leftF, rightF, leftB, rightB);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        drive.setXYRot(driveGamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_X), driveGamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_LEFT_Y),
                driveGamepad.axis(LogitechF310.STICK_RIGHT_X));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="important">Ideally you would use a KeyMap object to keep track of your
gamepad, but I did not include that in this lesson for simplicity sake.</p>

<p>Here are a few other things worth mentioning about the robot library's drive
objects that don't really fit into this lesson but aren't long enough to create
their own lesson from: </p>

<ul>
  <li>You could also do the same thing with a tank drive.  Replace the
  <code>MecanumDrive</code> class with the <code>TankDrive</code> class.</li>
  <li>You can also implement a field oriented drive system using the robot
  library. instantiate a <code>FieldOrientedDrive</code> object, and give it a
  drive object to control.  (Probably mecanum).</li>
</ul>
