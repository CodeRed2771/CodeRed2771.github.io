<p>Let's learn about about analog inputs.  A common use of an analog input is
potentiometers (informally called a pot).  In the context of robotics, a pot is
usually used to determine what angle a mechanism is at.  Another really cool use
of a pot is in a string potentiometer.  Code Red has used these for the past several
years, and we highly recommend your team look into them if they haven't already.
You can purchase them <a href="http://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-2674.htm">on
AndyMark</a>, or make them yourself for a little bit cheaper.  Basically they
are 3D printed enclosures with a retractable key chain wound around inside + a
spring + a potentiometer.  You can use the potentiometer to measure how far the
string is pulled out.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>AnalogPotentiometer</code> class to read from a
potentiometer.  I'm only going to go over the basics of this object, but you can
read the full documentation <a href="http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/classedu_1_1wpi_1_1first_1_1wpilibj_1_1AnalogPotentiometer.html">here</a>
if you want.  Let's get down and dirty... declare and instantiate an
<code>AnalogPotentiometer</code> object:</p>

{% highlight java %}
AnalogPotentiometer pot;
pot = new AnalogPotentiometer(0); // this pot is plugged into analog input 0
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Just like a <code>DigitalInput</code>, we can use the <code>get()</code>
method to get the state of the potentiometer.  This time, <code>get()</code> is
going to return a double instead of a boolean.  This double represents the
current reading of the potentiometer.  Say that we have a pot attached to an
arm, and are using it to get the angle.  We could do something like this:</p>

{% highlight java %}
double angle = pot.get();
// do something with that angle, for example:
if (angle > 2) {
    // take action
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you need to know where a certain manipulator is, a limit switch is not
always practical.  In these cases, a potentiometer is usually needed, so I want
you to practice with a real situation.  I've actually already covered all I need
to say for potentiometers.  I am going to leave an exersise below, that you
should really try, that modifies the above code.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that an <code>AnalogPotentiometer</code>'s
<code>get()</code>  method does not return an angle when it is setup like we
have set it up above. Rather, it just returns the value of that Potentiometer's
analog input.  Usually this value ranges from 0 - 5ish. You actually can setup a
potentiometer to return an angle, but you need to use a different constructor.
Measure the analog value of your potentiometer when it is at full range.  You
can then use this constructor which will make the <code>get()</code> method
scale its output to the appriate degree value:</p>

{% highlight java %}
int channel = 0;
double fullRange = 4.32; // The analog value when your pot is at full range
double offset = 0; // Use this if you have a desired offset.
AnalogPotentiometer pot = new AnalogPotentiometer(channel, fullRange, offset);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>See the <a href="http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/classedu_1_1wpi_1_1first_1_1wpilibj_1_1AnalogPotentiometer.html">
official documentation</a> for the <code>AnalogPotentiometer</code> class for
more information</p>

<p>I do want to mention the <code>AnalogInput</code> class that the WPI Java
Library offers.  You should use that if you need to get analog input but are not
using a potentiometer.  I'm actually going to talk about that more in the next
lesson if you need more detail.</p>

<h2>Exersises</h2>

<ul>
	<li>As mentioned earlier, a potentiometer can be used to track the position of
an object.  Setup a potentiometer that will only allow a motor to move within a
predetermined boundary. </li>
	<li>Setup a potentiometer that can adjust a motor's speed output.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Code Red's Robot Library</h2>

<p>Refer to the last lesson's "Using Code Red's Robot
Library.  The answer here is exactly the same, just use a
<code>VirtualizableAnalogInput</code> to replace <code>AnalogInput</code> in
your code.</p>
