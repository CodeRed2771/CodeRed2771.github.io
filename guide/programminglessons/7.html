<p>Please note that although Encoders use the digital input ports, this lesson
is not about Encoders.  <a href="18.html">See Lesson 18 for Encoders.</a></p>

<p>Getting digital inputs from the roboRIO is <i>super</i> easy.  There is a
<code>DigitalInput</code> class that allows you to do this.  Here's how you set
it up: </p>

{% highlight java %}
DigitalInput input;
input = new DigitalInput(0);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can see that the constructor takes a single integer.  Just like motor
controllers and joysticks, this represents the port that the digital input is
plugged into on the roboRIO.  The digital input above is plugged into port
0.</p>

<p>Now, to get the state of the digital input you use the <code>get()</code>
method.  Limit switches can be wired so that they are defaultly open or
defaultly closed.  If the limit switch is wired so that it defaultly open, then
the <code>get()</code> method will return <code>false</code> when the limit
switch is not pressed down, and <code>true</code> when it is pressed down.  If
the limit switch is wired so that it is defaultly closed, then it is the exact
opposite.  Here is how the <code>get()</code> method could be implemented:</p>

{% highlight java %}
if (input.get()) {
    // Perform an action, like stopping a motor
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That's actually all there is to it.  Some applications of limit switches
are: setting a calibration value, stopping a motor, causing another motor to
move (like a shooter), and more.  Here is a main robot class with a
<code>DigitalInput</code> completely set up: </p>

{% highlight java %}
DigitalInput input;

public void robotInit() {
    input = new DigitalInput(0);
}

public void teleopPeriodic() {
    if(input.get()) {
        // Perform an action, like stopping a motor
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>See if you can incorporate a limit switch into your existing code that we
started building in lesson 3.</p>

<h2>Exersises</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Make a motor that is controlled by a joystick not be able to run when a
limit switch has been pressed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Code Red's Robot Library</h2>

<p>Something that we are going to touch on in a <a href="34.html">much later
lesson</a> is input virtualization, which our library offers.  Code Red's robot
library has its own digital input class, called
<code>VirtualizableDigitalInput</code>.  This class offers no additional
features aside from input virtualization.  So if you are not planning on taking
advantage of input virtualization, then don't bother using our class.  However,
if you do what to use it so that it is already set up when you get to the
virtualization lesson, it is used <i>exactly</i> the same as
<code>DigitalInput</code>: just replace <code>DigitalInput</code> in
your code with <code>VirtualizableDigitalInput</code>.  Here is what the above
code would look like if it used Code Red's library:</p>

{% highlight java %}
VirtualizableDigitalInput input;

public void robotInit() {
    input = new VirtualizableDigitalInput(0);
}

public void teleopPeriodic() {
    if(input.get()) {
        // Perform an action, like stopping a motor
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
